Mermaid is a registration toolkit making use of automatic differentiation for rapid prototyping. It includes various image registration models. In particular, stationary velocity field models (both based on velocity fields and momentum fields) as well as scalar and vector momentum Large Displacement Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) models.
